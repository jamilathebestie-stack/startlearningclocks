      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Clocks are devices designed to measure and display time. While they may look simple from the
        outside, clocks are made up of many small parts that must work together precisely. This website
        explains the basic structure of clocks and how they are built.

      <h2>Main Parts of a Clock</h2>
      <p>Most analog clocks include the following components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clock Face:</strong> Displays the numbers or markers used to read time.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands:</strong> The hour, minute, and sometimes second hand that move to show time.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> The internal mechanism that controls how the hands move.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Either a battery, a wound spring, or weights.</li>
        <li><strong>Frame or Case:</strong> Holds all parts together and protects the mechanism.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How a Clock Is Built</h2>
      <p>
        Building a clock starts with designing or selecting a movement. The movement is attached to
        the clock face, and the hands are carefully mounted on the central shaft. The power source is
        then connected to allow the movement to function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the internal parts are assembled, the entire mechanism is placed inside a case. The clock
        is tested to ensure the hands move smoothly and keep accurate time.

      <h2>What the Image Represents</h2>
      <p>
        The image above shows a simple clock drawing with scattered numbers and hands. This represents
        the process of building a clock by starting with individual components and assembling them into
        a complete working timepiece.

      <h2>Why Clock Design Matters</h2>
      <p>
        A well-designed clock must be accurate, readable, and durable. Even small mistakes in
        construction can cause a clock to lose or gain time. This is why clockmaking requires both
        creativity and precision.
